# Credit-Scoring Modelling
This project is a credit scoring case study developed in Python using a Jupyter notebook. The workflow includes data analysis, variable analysis (distribution, statistics, anomaly detection), outlier analysis, feature engineering, and model development with alternative algorithms such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest. The project also covers model performance evaluation using key KPIs and graphical visualizations.
